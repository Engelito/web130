        Why will you enjoy our site?</p><br>
        This is a site that is designed to give some students a platform to be able to sell their art to the<br>
        outside world. It can be difficult for students to find an audience that is interested in new and<br>
        upcoming art pieces. This platform allows an audience who are interested in upcoming art to<br>
        seek new talent and artwork. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?<br>
        The type of activity that will be done on my site will be scrolling through artwork<br>
         for their own amusement. The audience can see what kind of artwork is being done by<br>
          byui graduates or alumni. This site will also give the audience the opportunity to<br>
           be able to buy the art piece from the artist. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this<br>
         information or complete the actions?<br>
        Our audience will mainly consist of people that have or are studying at <br>
        BYU-I, worked here or are involved within the BYU-I art community. The BYU-I<br>
        art community is always looking to help out their local artists, whether it's<br>
        just looking at their work, attending their art events or buying something they like. <br>

        are their backgrounds and what kind of artwork do they specialize in. The <br>
        site is meant for the audience to be able to connect to the artist.<br>

        involved with art since the first grade. Though he was told early on that artists<br>
         wouldn’t make much money in the future, he still dedicated most of his free time <br>

          in graphic design since he could never let go of the passion he has for Art. <br>

        Karla Harris - Born and raised in the Heart of San Diego, California, Karla had always<br>
         been colored since she was a toddler. Her parents noticed at a young age that she was<br>
          very creative and gave her the tools to make sure she was able to express herself through<br>
           her art. Karla ended up graduating in Graphic design as well as creating her own visual<br>
            art events showing the entire school and her community what she has to offer. <br>

         their story. We also need to be able to obtain that artist’s artwork so we may display<br>
          it to the audience on the website as well as the price that they would put on the page.<br>
